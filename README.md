## Overview
Air quality plays a critical role in human health and the environment. In this project, we develop a machine learning model to forecast the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** based on various pollutants. The model aims to predict future AQI values, assisting in issuing health alerts, formulating environmental policies, and optimizing industrial and traffic management.

### Factors Affecting Air Quality:
- PM2.5 and PM10: Particulate matter
- NO, NO2, NOx: Nitrogen oxides
- NH3: Ammonia
- CO: Carbon monoxide
- SO2: Sulfur dioxide
- O3: Ozone
- Benzene, Toluene, Xylene: Volatile organic compounds

By predicting future AQI values, we can monitor air quality trends, prevent hazardous health conditions, and make informed decisions to improve environmental quality.

## Business Problem
The project aims to predict future AQI values by analyzing pollutant levels using machine learning algorithms. Accurate predictions will help:
- Issue public health alerts in response to poor air quality.
- Develop environmental regulations and policies.
- Optimize industrial output and traffic management.
- Improve the quality of life by ensuring a cleaner environment.

## Datasets and Features
The data includes readings of various pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO, SO2, O3, and others. The key features used for prediction include:
- **Date:** The time of data recording.
- **Pollutant Levels:** Recorded values of pollutants affecting air quality.
- **AQI:** The target variable representing the Air Quality Index.

## Data Challenges
Some known issues with the data include:
- **Missing Data:** Several columns, including the target AQI, have missing values.
- **Unit Differences:** Date columns need to be processed and converted into appropriate formats.
- **Seasonal Variations:** Air quality is affected by seasonal patterns that can introduce variability in the data.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Gather air quality and pollutant data from public sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize pollutant levels, and process date-time information.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features such as lagged variables or moving averages to capture trends.
4. **Model Building:** Train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Linear Regression) to predict AQI.
5. **Evaluation:** Measure model performance using RMSE, MAE, or other suitable metrics.
6. **Prediction:** Use the trained model to forecast future AQI values.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **ML Algorithms:** Random Forest, Linear Regression, XGBoost

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/air-quality-prediction-ml.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train the model:

## Results
The model's predictions of AQI can be visualized using time series plots to observe trends over time. Performance metrics such as RMSE and MAE will give insight into the model's accuracy.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporating more data sources for pollutants and meteorological data.
- Exploring deep learning models for more accurate forecasting.
- Deploying the model as a web application to provide real-time AQI predictions.
